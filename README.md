# Haskell Undefined Value Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: using `undefined` without proper handling.  The `bug.hs` file contains the problematic code, which attempts to add 1 to an undefined value. The `bugSolution.hs` file shows a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The `undefined` value in Haskell represents a value that hasn't been defined.  Attempting to use it in a calculation or any other operation results in a runtime exception.
